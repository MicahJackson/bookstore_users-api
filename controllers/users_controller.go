package controllers

// controller is for validating that we have all of the necessary parameters to handle the service request
// functions are the entry point of our application
// somehow we need an entry point, or http server, that handles all of the requests and redirects each request to a given controller based on the given "path"(?).

// application and controllers are the only layers that should interact with the server
